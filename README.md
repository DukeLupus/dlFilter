# dlFilter
dlFilter is a text filtering script for mIRC. It is created with file sharing channels in mind. DLFilter removes ads, requests, annoying KeepTrack, mp3 play &amp; away messages and much more. Also, DLFilter can send notices from fileservers to separate window and group find results, allowing them to be easily viewed.


## Installation and overview
Extract the contents of DLFilter.zip to your mIRC folder, type into any mIRC window: /load -rs DLFilter.mrc and press enter. That will load DLFilter and launch the configuration window. (note: these images show the default configuration of the filter). Please note that some other scripts may interfere with filtering, causing various problems. Especially usage of mIRC theme system (MTS) should be avoided.
