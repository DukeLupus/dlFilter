# dlFilter
dlFilter is a text filtering script for mIRC. It is created with file sharing channels in mind. DLFilter removes ads, requests, annoying KeepTrack, mp3 play &amp; away messages and much more. Also, DLFilter can send notices from fileservers to separate window and group @find results, allowing them to be easily viewed.
