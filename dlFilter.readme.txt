Installation:

The first time you download the script, you need to install it. Once you have installed it, automated or manual updates should not need you to install it again.

Extract the contents of dlFilter.zip to your mIRC scripts folder.
Load into mIRC by typing the following into any mIRC window and pressing enter:
/load -rs1 dlFilter.mrc
The dlFilter options dialog window will open for you to configure dlFilter to your needs.

Note 1: dlFilter loads itself automatically as the first script to run (or the second if you are also running sbClient). This avoids problems where other scripts halt events.
Note 2: Some other scripts may interfere with filtering, causing various problems. In particular usage of mIRC theme system (MTS) should be avoided.
