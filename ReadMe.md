dlFilter is a text filtering script for mIRC. It is created with file sharing channels in mind.

In 2017, dlFilter has received a significant upgrade from the previous major release 1.16 with significant new functionality, which we hope will encourage strong take-up.

Feedback on this new version is appreciated. Now that dlFilter is hosted on Github, we welcome contributions of bug fixes and further improvement from the community.
