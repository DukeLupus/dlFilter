# dlFilter
## dlFilter.mrc - Filter out messages on file sharing channels
### Authors: DukeLupus and Sophist
dlFilter is a text filtering script for mIRC. It is created with file sharing channels in mind.

In 2017, dlFilter received a significant upgrade from the previous major release 1.16 with significant new functionality, which we hope will encourage strong take-up.

Feedback on this new version is appreciated. Now that dlFilter is hosted on Github, we welcome contributions of bug fixes and further improvement from the community.

## Downloading
The best way to download the latest formal release of the script is to 
go to the [Releases Page](https://github.com/DukeLupus/dlFilter/releases) and download the zip file.

## Installing
The best place to install scripts is in your mIRC settings directory (use the mIRC command "//echo -a $mircdir" to find out where this is) or in a scripts subdirectory.

When you have placed the file in the directory you want, then use the mIRC command //load -rs1 [directory]\dlFilter.mrc

## Upgrading
The best way to upgrade if you are on dlFilter v2 is to use the built in upgrader. Otherwise, download the dlFilter.mrc script as above, repalce your old version with the new version and restart mIRC.
